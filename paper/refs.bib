  abstractNote = {The Toolkit for Advanced Optimization (TAO) focuses on the development of algorithms and software for the solution of large-scale optimization problems on high-performance architectures. Areas of interest include unconstrained and bound-constrained optimization, nonlinear least squares problems, optimization problems with partial differential equation constraints, and variational inequalities and complementarity constraints. The development of TAO was motivated by the scattered support for parallel computations and the lack of reuse of external toolkits in current optimization software. Our aim is to produce high-quality optimization software for computing environments ranging from workstations and laptops to massively parallel high-performance architectures. Our design decisions are strongly motivated by the challenges inherent in the use of large-scale distributed memory architectures and the reality of working with large, often poorly structured legacy codes for specific applications.},
