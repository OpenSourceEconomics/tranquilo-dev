\begin{itemize}
    \item the four problems from slides
    \item properties of residuals: continuously differentiable but Jacobian not available
    \item examples
        \begin{itemize}
            \item check for examples of pure least-squares problem application
            \item MSM and GMM and cholesky trick
            \item calibration of engineering problems (Janos)
            \item the covid model
        \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
