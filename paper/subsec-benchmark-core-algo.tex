\subsection{Benchmarking}
\begin{itemize}
    \item describe the more-wild benchmark set
    \item show plot competition\_ls
    \item describe the plot axes:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item x: number of function evaluations normalized by the best result
            \item y: share of the problems solved
        \end{itemize}
    \item show plot scalar\_and\_ls to highlight that scalar optimizers are not well fit for ls problems
\end{itemize}
