\section{Tranquilo core algorithm}
\label{sec:tranquilo-core}
We design the Tranquilo algorithm to locally solve the nonlinear least-squares problems \ref{eq:problem-ls-det} and \ref{eq:problem-ls-noise} by employing a trust region framework. In contrast to general \textit{black box} optimization, however we take advantage of the least-squares structure by building approximation models for each residual $r_i$, as opposed to the full objective $f$.
