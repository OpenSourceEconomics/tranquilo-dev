\subsection{Motivation}
\label{subsec:intro-motiv}


Least-squares estimators have a wide range of applications in industrial and scientific settings. Apart from problems that have obvious least-squares structure, many problems can obtain a least-squares representation through some transformations. In particular, consider the following objective function:
\begin{align}
    Q(\theta) = G(\theta)^TWG(\theta)
    \label{eq:vec-gmm-msm}
\end{align}
Where $m\in\mathbb{R}^L$ is a vector valued function of the parameter of interest $\theta$, and $W$ is a $L\times L$ weighting matrix. In case of the gerneralized method of moments estimator, $G$ is the sample average of a vector valued function $g$:
\begin{align}
    G(\theta) = \frac{1}{N}\sum\limits_{i=1}^Ng(x_i,\theta)
    \label{eq:m-gmm}
\end{align}
Whereas in the case of method of simulated moments estimator, $m$ is the difference between simulated and observed moments:
\begin{align}
    G(\theta) = (m(X)-\hat{m(X|\theta)})
\end{align}

Through a Cholesky decomposition of the weighting matrix $W = U^TU$, we can rewrite the objective of the problem \ref{eq:vec-gmm-msm} in the following least-squares form:
\begin{align}
    Q(\theta)=G(\theta)^TU^TUG(\theta)=(UG(\theta))^T(UG(\theta))=\sum\limits_{i=1}^L\Big(\sum\limits_{j=i}^LU_{ji}G_j(\theta)\Big)^2\equiv\sum\limits_{i=1}^{L}f_i(\theta)^2
\end{align}

motivating noise handling:
\begin{itemize}
    \item write that least-squares optimization problems can have noisy residuals
    \item bring one example: look into wild/stochastic objectives/structured objectives and dfols
    \item write equation least-square noisy from the slides
    \item bring examples of existing approaches (dfols and two more from wild (astrodf?))
    \item say that picking sequences are hard to get right for domain-experts since there would need to know the algorithm in-detail to be able to pick parameters efficiently
    \item say that's why our approach determines the number of function evaluations internally, based on the progress of the optimizer and the complexity is completely hidden away from the user.
\end{itemize}
