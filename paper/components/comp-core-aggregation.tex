\subsubsection{Aggregation}
\label{subsubsec:aggregation}
\hfill\\


\begin{itemize}
    \item for aggregation the fitting method does not matter, only the presence of hessian does
    \item discuss how dfbgn does aggregation, but that we follow dfols for linear residuals.
    \item pounders for quadratic linear models
    \item identity for scalar optimization
    \item formulas for the scalar model for linear(dfols) and square residual models (pounders)
\end{itemize}
