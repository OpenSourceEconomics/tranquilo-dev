\subsubsection{Aggregation}

\hfill\\


\begin{itemize}
    \item for aggregation the fitting method does not matter, only the presence of hessian does
    \item discuss how dfgn does aggregation, but that we follow dfols for linear residuals. In aggregation, only difference between dfols and dfgn is 1/2 in the formulation of the problem
    \item

    \begin{itemize}
        \item non linear least-squares problems
        \item local linear interpolation models to approximate jacbian
        \item approximate residuals with linear models.
        \item the scalar model is the square of the 2-norm, like in tranquilo.
    \end{itemize}
    \item pounders for quadratic linear models
    \item identity for scalar optimization
    \item formulas for the scalar model for linear(dfols) and square residual models (pounders)
\end{itemize}
